            Calling all garlic bread fans!Domino's Pizza are on the hunt for someone to take on the role of their Chief Garlic Bread Taste Tester.<p>And honestly it sounds like a dream job - the only real experience you need is a "minimum of five years' in garlic bread consumption" and you'll be able to spend a day sampling the company's delicious garlic breads and even get to try some new products.If that weren't enough you'll also be paid for your time.There's just one major catch - the role isn't based in the UK, it's in Brisbane, Australia.</p><p>Though for some, that's probably a plus as it means a trip down under to Domino's HQ in Brisbane.The job advert, shared on LinkedIn, explains: "You butter believe it! We're looking for someone a little bit crunchy, but mostly warm and soft on the inside, to help taste test our World-Famous Garlic Breads at Domino's Headquarters."It goes on to say that the ideal candidate will have "never met a carb they didn't like", "does not identify as a vampire", "understands the perfect 'crunch to softness' ratio" and "is passionate baout food, innovation and having fun".</p></div>

            <p>When American football fan Carson King cheekily held up a sign on TV asking for people to send him money to buy beer, he didn't expect to receive a cent.Now, just over a week on, he's raised more than a $1m (£800,000) and is donating the funds to a children's hospital.</p>

            <p>I was hoping to make a couple people laugh! I never expected to be on TV, and definitely did not except anyone to send any money," he told Sky News.Referencing a beer brand, Mr King's sign read "Busch Light Supply Needs Replenished" and gave his username for mobile payment service Venmo.</p>
